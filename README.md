# FoI_bayesian
Fitting force-of-infection (catalytic) models to age-(sero)prevalence data, incorporating diagnostic uncertainty (sensitvity and specificity) for single datasets and multiple datasets utilising a common diagnostic test. 
Key parameters estimated are the FoI (per capita rate of seroconversion for antibody-based datasets/ infection acquisition for antigen and direct observation of parasite stages e.g. necropsy-based datasets) in the simple cataltyic model, and the FoI and seroreversion/loss of infection rate in the reversible catalytic model scripts. 
Diagnostic priors are incorporated as beta distributions, specified by alpha and beta shape parameters in the fitting procedure.
